### **Example Use Case**: Building a Q&A system for a PDF research paper.
---

### **Ingestion: Preparing the Document**

1. **Loading the Document**  
   Load a PDF research paper into the system.

   ```python
   from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

   # Load the PDF
   loader = PyPDFLoader("research_paper.pdf")
   documents = loader.load()
   print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} pages from the document.")
   ```

2. **Splitting the Document**  
   Divide the document into smaller chunks for processing.

   ```python
   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

   # Split the document into chunks
   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
   chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
   print(f"Split document into {len(chunks)} chunks.")
   ```

3. **Creating Embeddings**  
   Convert the chunks into vector embeddings.

   ```python
   from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

   # Generate embeddings
   embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
   chunk_embeddings = [embeddings.embed_document(chunk) for chunk in chunks]
   print("Embeddings created for all chunks.")
   ```

4. **Storing in a Vector Store**  
   Store these embeddings in a vector database for retrieval.

   ```python
   from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

   # Save embeddings in FAISS
   vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
   print("Embeddings stored in FAISS vector database.")
   ```

### **Generation: Answering the Question**

1. **Accepts a User's Question**  
   Take a question from the user.

   ```python
   user_query = "What are the main findings of the research?"
   ```

2. **Finds Relevant Content**  
   Use the vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks for the query.

   ```python
   from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAChain
   from langchain.llms import OpenAI

   # Set up retriever
   retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k":3})

   # Use a QA chain to retrieve relevant content
   llm = OpenAI(model="text-davinci-003")
   qa_chain = RetrievalQAChain.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
   ```

3. **Generates an Answer**  
   Generate the answer based on the retrieved content.
   ```python
   answer = qa_chain.run(user_query)
   print(f"Answer: {answer}")
   ```

---

### **Output Walkthrough**

- **Loading**: The PDF is loaded into the system as `documents`.
- **Splitting**: The PDF is split into manageable chunks with overlapping sections for context.
- **Embedding**: The chunks are embedded into high-dimensional vectors.
- **Storage**: The embeddings are stored in FAISS, making them searchable.
- **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks.
- **Answer Generation**: An LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved content.

### **Illustrative Result**

**User Question**: "What are the main findings of the research?"  
**System Answer**: "The research highlights that X intervention improves Y outcomes by Z% according to the data in Table 2."

This demonstrates how LangChain simplifies ingestion and generation phases for creating a scalable, efficient Q&A system.
